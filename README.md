# Demon With A Candy Crisis

A 3D platformer developed in Unity, designed as a complete game rather than a prototype. This project focuses on building all core systems expected in a shipped title, including player onboarding, persistent saving, audio integration, and a defined progression toward an ending.

The game is currently in active development and has a publicly playable demo.
