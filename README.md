Video game I am currently working on (1/4/25).
Main idea for it is to mix my third person controller and a dialogue system (was suppose to be a typing game).
Hoping to make this have an actual start and end to the game with all the things you would want like menus, win screen, sound effects, a pause screen, etc.
